# Statistical Analysis Exercises

This respository contains two different statistical analysis exercises. One exercise investigates whether or not the actual average human temperature 98.6 degrees F. A dataset with the internal body temperatures of males and females was used. The average internal body temperature for males and females were calculated. Males were found to have an average temperature of 98.1 degrees while women had an average temperature of 98.3 degrees. Using the distribution of data and the bell curve, it was found that any temperature below 98.12 degrees and above 98.38 can be considered abnormal. Calculating the p-value also discovered that the difference between male and female temperature was statistically significant.

The second exercise sought to see if race plays a role in whether or not a candidate receives a call back in response to their application for a job. The dataset used in this exercise included rows for each resume submitted. Numerical values were given to each coressponding resume indicating white-sounding names versus black-sounding names. Numerical values were also assigned whether or not the applicant recieved a call back. Data visualizations and statistical analysis found that white-sounding names received a call back 10% of the time while black-sounding names received a call back 6% of the time.
